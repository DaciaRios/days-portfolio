    <p>I am pursuing a bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science and have collaborated on a variety of projects that use programming languages such as Python, C++, and a bit of JavaScript. 
          I hope to be able to use the experience I have gained to increase my work efficiency for future internships and jobs.</p>
